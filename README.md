# **Film Recommendator**
## INTRODUCTION
So you want to watch a movie, but you're not quite sure which one. You open your favourite streaming platform and... BOOM! Dozens of options fill your screen. You start searching, but there are just too many options for you to read through the synopsis so you end up watching silly cats on Youtube.

Well, we've got you. With this app, you can have a few film recommendations based on your likes so you don't have to dig through the entire streaming platform. You just have to type in a couple of films you like and it will give you back a few movie recommendations based on that input.

## PURPOSE
This app is created mainly as a practice excercise in Python and to save time when deciding on a movie to watch.
